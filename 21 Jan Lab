file carving - magic numbers - signatures 

it looks into those special bytes stored in that cluster/sector - we will search for some special magic numbers and will search for headers and footers and will be special to the type of data is being stored there .. 

meta data of file -> we will be able to retrieve the data ..

scalpel 

cd /etc/scalpel
edit the scalpel.conf with the help of nano and put more file signatures or enable/disable file signature

little endian -> arithmetic operations are easy and memory accessing is easy

always create an empty directory before running this tool
sudo scalpel -c /etc/scalpel/scalpel.conf -o ~/scalout pd_image1.dd

magic bytes are unique whole over the world
we won’t be able to carve the meta data from this tool

sudo feh 0000* -> command to see the images from terminal (binary to images) -> it will show small small thumbnails :)

what thing run in the backend in scalpel tool to retrieve the data and magic bytes
we need to know how to read the file -> file handling steps .. we can use C program to read the file .. we need read, write functions in OS .. 
we need a file pointer to point to a particular file .. 


similar to scalpel we have foremost
sudo apt-get install foremost 

not much difference between foremost and scalpel

find the foremost.conf -> /etc/ -> foremost.conf

sudo nano foremost.conf 
it will be similar to scalpel.conf

foremost can’t work larger files of greater than 4GB
suitable for small disks

xdg-open xyz.pdf
feh filename.jpg

libreoffice to open .doc, .ppt file etc




scalpel is written over foremost
scalpel can work with larger files with upto 16EB

sudo foremost -t jpg -i pd_image1.dd -o ~/foremost_out


sudo apt-get install recoverjpeg -> to extract images(jpeg)


bulk-extracter -> it also looks for the system image .. 
sudo apt-get install bulk-extractor

sudo bulk_extractor -o bulkout pd_image.dd
it gives output in text files


magic rescue tool

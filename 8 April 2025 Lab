stegnography

how we can suspect
file command - it will tell what type of file it is irrespective of extension
eg. file hello.sys
exiftool command - similar to above but detailed
eg. exiftool hello.sys

hiding in plane view

echo “hello students” > .hidden -> this is hidden file
for this we need to use ls -a

ntfs - alternate data stream - save the folks inside other file meaning storing child files in parent file
setting attributes in linux - similar to alternate data stream but not same



alternate data stream demo in windows
D:\> echo this is a secret > secret.txt
dir *.txt -> file will be of 19 bytes lets say
notepad secret.txt:catchme.txt

notepad will open click on yes
and write the text here and save

dir *.txt -> still same 19 bytes
type secret.txt -> this is a secret 

how to check that hidden file

dir /R -> it will recursively find the alternate files


go to google and search -> sysinternals -> streams tool — help to manage these alternate streams


download and extract it

run this command in cmd then > streams.exe secret.txt




now open powershell ise

go to D drive

D:\> Get-Content .\secret.txt -Stream catchme.txt | Set-Content extracted.txt
dir *.txt

type extracted.txt -> this will show the text of that file





now back to linux

nano prog.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf(“Password=1234, this is a secret”);
	int a=5, b=5;
	printf(“\nsum=%d”, a+b);
}


gcc -g prog.c -o prog.exe

hello.sys is jpg image file but we have changed the extension 
cat hello.sys prog.exe > image.jpg

feh image.jpg
file image.jpg
exif image.jpg

sudo apt install binwalk -> tool to find this type of data

file prog.exe -> ELF (Executable linkable format)
xxd prog.exe | less -> 7f45 (elf file format)


binwalk -e image.jpg
binwalk —dd “.*” image.jpg -> it will extract all the files that are hidden in this image file
cd _image.jpg.extracted
ls -> it will list out the memory sector no

chmod +x 72A -> here 72A is address of that executable

./72A

msg will be printed
mv 72A mal.exe
gdb ./mal.exe

list -> now it will show the source code of that program
q

strings ./mal.exe

put break points and and dissect the program

 


sudo apt install steghide

echo “this is secret msg” > secret.txt
steghide embed -cf pen.jpeg -ef  secret.txt
then it will ask to enter the passphrase
-cf means cover file .. means the parent file
-ef means embedded file 


steghide -sf pen.jpeg
-sf means stego file
and then enter the passphrase to open the steg file that u have generated above

gitra tool

strip exe name 
strip prog1.exe -> it will generate the stripped file no debugging symbols and all

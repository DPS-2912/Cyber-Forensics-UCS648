sudo fdisk -l -> it will list all the available disks connected to the device
sudo fdisk -x
c/h/s -> cylinder/head/sector 
sudo sfdisk -h

sudo md5sum /dev/sda1

dc3dd - more better options than dd .. it is apatch written over dd .. dd with more options … developed in US .. by department of defence … https://www.dc3.mil/Products/DC3-Validations

dcfldd - by dcfl lab .. included in newer language or we can install it too

dc3dd and dcfldd are similar in options



dd - disk duplicator .. by default available in all linux distros .. copy from one file to another bit by bit


31050db30ab4a59c4b98b600b1a512a7  /dev/sda1

sudo dc3dd if=/dev/sda1 of=path_to_store_the_image log=path_of_log_file hash=md5 ofsiz=25M ofs=pd_image.000

ofsiz -> offset size to split the image into parts
ofs -> offset image file name start

cat pd_image.* | dc3dd of=combined.dd

sudo dc3dd if=/dev/sda1 of=path_to_store_the_image log=path_of_log_file hash=md5 ofsiz=25M hofs=pd_image.000 

hofs -> hash the each output file

sudo dcfldd wipe=/dev/sdk
sudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdk pat=
to wipe the device so that data between the cases donot clash with each other


error logs can be created in dcfldd not in dc3dd

to see the hexadecimal pattern of disk
xxd pd_image.001 | more
hexdump pd_image.001 | more

mz -> signature of .exe
55aa -> signature of boot sector


sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=pd_imag3.dd
but it won’t tell what is running in the background



How to take out first sector from the device
sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=mbr bs=512 count=1
bs=512 it is default sector that we extracted by running fdisk

count -> no of blocks
limit -> how many bytes of this type


mbr = master boot record .. it will help to load the OS in the ram 
it will scan the partition table so it will get to know that it has mbr in it

attribute = 80 .. it will tell that partition is bootable or not .. when we will do fdisk and last column will be attributes and boot column will have ‘*’ which will indicate that the partition / device is bootable


volume boot record
Disk /dev/sdb -> mbr

Device
/dev/sdb1 -> vbr

so each partition will have one volume boot record .. so if you increase one partition so total no of 55aa signature will increase to 3 

so by default each device will have atleast mbr + vbr (total 2 in number)

seek command to jump any particular sector -> check this command how to use

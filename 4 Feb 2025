sudo apt-get install sleuthkit
sleuthkit is composition of many binaries and that can be used to extract the files from image file

img_stat - will give info about this file
img_stat pd_image.dd
img_stat -i list -> to see the supported image files

mmstat -i list -> gives information abt memory
mmstat pd_image.dd
> dos .. it shows that the image file have been partitioned by dos table
mmstat -t list -> it will show how the disk file have been partitioned

partition table is residing in first sector of boot  .. 
How will you extract first sector of boot
sudo dd if=pd_image2.dd of=mbr bs=512 count=1

xxd mbr -> hexdump of mbr that we have extracted above
dos have limitation of 4 physical partition
sudo fdisk -l
in partition table entry format
0 -> bootable flag (80 -> bootable else 0)
1-3 -> starting chs (cylinder head sector)
4 -> partition type
5-7 -> ending chs address
8-11 -> lba (logical block address) -> this is in little endian order .. so read it reverse
12-15 -> size in sectors

mmls -> list partition table entries offset
mmls pd_image2.dd

fsstat -o 8064 pd_image2.dd | less -> give more infor abt file system
here 8064 is the offset that we have found from the partition table

8192-8199 (8) -> 3153920 it means the file is fragmented and is stored at 3153920 sector
8200-8303 (104) -> EOF it means file is not fragmented and is completely stored here

fat stores the meta data info with data part 

fls -o 8064 pd_image2.dd
it will give all the meta data of files stored here in this image file

d/d -> directory
r/r -> regular file
v/v -> some special files (fat1, fat2, mbr)

r/r 3: here 3 is inode (no given to cluster { collection of sectors [majorly 8 sectors in the cluster]} and here inode is diff from os)

r/r * 123: here * means that this particular data has been deleted from this image file

icat -> to recover individual file from image file
icat -o 8064 pd_image2.dd 50331742 > comments3.docx
libreoffice
tsk_recover -> copy all the content from image file and will bring to you
tsk_recover -h
tsk_recover -o 8064 -e pd_image2.dd ~/output


we can do imaging of image file also




Sleuth kit is a tool and in which we have binaries like tsk_recover, icat

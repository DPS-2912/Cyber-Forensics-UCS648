delete some partition from file system .. then it won’t be detected by the file system and it will be marked as unallocated 
dmesh -> log of kernel related activites

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
> p -> list down all the partitions of that drive
> d -> which partition is to be deleted
> w -> write the changes back to the disk (that was modified above) .. partition table will be altered

sudo fdisk -l .. u will see that partiton that u chose above has been deleted


sudo testdisk -> select partition -> select Analyze -> here u will see that available partitions and break in sector number as the partition is deleted -> run quick search -> run deeper search -> it will list down the deleted partitions also

then use left and right arrow key to change the partitions like from D(deleted) to P(primary)
then press enter and write this structure to the disk
then run again the sudo fdisk-l
shift C to copy

someone can hide the data by deleting the partition but you should know abt this

sudo photorec (carving tool written by cgsecurity)





downlaod autopsy
make a case folder
and 3 subfolders in that
1. Documentation -> create a txt file and utilize it to save logs and the things that we have performed there
2. ImageFile -> image file of drive
3. Autopsy -> here all the files will be generated by autopsy software



xry text report -> software for mobile forensics



exifn 2.sys tool -> get metadata of that file -> will also give the MIME type of that file
file -i 2.sys -> will give mime type of that file


outlook makes pst/ost files in windows to store the email data

in autopsy if you don’t know that the image that u got is of which time zone .. then set that as UCT (GMT +0.00)
nsrl (national software reference library)-> it maintains a hash list of standard files such as standard OS, hash of all the files related to standarad files
virustotal .. can search for that hash
ingest modules

1. recent activity -> will try to capture browser data and some other type of datas
2. hash lookup (data quilling techniques -> so it won’t search through that standard hashes)
go to global settings and give the parth of that hash file
3. file type identification -> (MIME type .. exntension of SMTP{it will only recognize only ASCII} text)
4. extension mismatch detector -> if the file mime type and extension is mismatching
5. embedded file extractor -> if file is embedded inside another file
6. picture analyzer -> analyze the picture including the exif data
7. keyword search -> keyword based searching (email, phone, ip address, url etc)
8. email parser -> pst/ost files
9. encryption detecition -> if data have more entropy then it is encrypted .. means random text is too much .. can be used to detect the malware also .. pe lord software also have this feature to find the file on the basis of entropy . 
10. interesting files identifier -> if some one using encryption software or cloud storage or cryptograhy or vpns or execution & privacy programs
11. central repository -> creates a central repo to maintain a standarad db .. so it will check the current case findings in previous cae findings also from a central repo
12. photorec carver 
13. virtual machine extractor -> will search for vm files
14. data source integrity -> will check the hashes and data integrity
15. android analyzer (aLEAPP) -> to check the android files
16. DJI Drone analyzer -> drone have special file format and if that files are opened or saved can be detected
17. Plaso -> extract the timelines .. at what time what thing is happened in the system .. how the registeries have been changed .. PE files can also be detected
18. YARA Analyzer -> malware detector .. each malware ahs yara rules .. which have basic traits of malware .. suppose a special msg that a malware possess
19. iOS Analyzer (iLEAPP) -> used to analyze ios images
20. GPX Parser -> used to process geolocation data from drones or images or some other source
21. Android Analyzer -> 3rd party tool .. diff from aLEAPP


then click on next .. and it will create a layout .. and list down all the finidings that it have found
when u mark any file as suspicious then it will be stored in central repo as suspicious and can be used in future
we can see all the meta data of files … 


autopsy is used to hve the holistic report of the image file :)

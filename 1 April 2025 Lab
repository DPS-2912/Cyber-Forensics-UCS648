RAM Imaging Tool - Volatile Memory -
volatility foundation 

for windows the video is available on drive folder and one ram image is available on lms that is infected with malware - cridex.vmem

in this doc how to do volatility in linux
https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility -> clone this
or https://volatilityfoundation.org .. we will use v2.6 not v3


these tools can be used to image the ram
lime toolbox
ftk imager
ram capture


volatility is composed of lot of pugins
python2 vol.py --info

python2 vol.py -f <location of ram memory image file> imageinfo
this will give the memory image

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist
it will show the urnning processes when the dump was taken

System Represent the kernel process - first process that runs
smss.exe - system manager sub system

EPROCESS structure 
active process links 

pslist scanned all the EPROCESS structures of memory 

malwares/rootkits will detach themselves from active process links and get resided in memory so that they can’t be detected

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 psscan
to check if any one have detached from active links or not

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 pstree
to get parent child relationship in form of tree

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 psxview
process enumeration plugins - searching for details of the process
here look for the False processes

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 connscan
will look for active connections for the processes that it is making

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 sockets
to get deep down details in network

python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 cmdline
to see if any command is using the terminal or not

after this every pugin will run on process id
python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p <pid> -D <folder>
folder should already be created 

then compute the md5sum hash
then go to virus total / mxtoolbox -> blacklist and check if that it is malicious or not

there is another way to take the dump of process also
python2 vol.py -f <location> —profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p 1640 —dir rest check the command in the ppt

python2 ./vol.py -f ~/Desktop/cridex.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 memdump -p 1640 --dump-dir .
to take the memory dump of the process

commit charge - no of pages it has taken
memcommit - no of pages that it has comited in. memory

vads - virtual adress space protection

private memory - no shared memory 

protection - check it

dtb - use to map the pages in memory and pages



python2 ./vol.py -f ~/Desktop/cridex.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 printkey -K "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
above command will tell which programs will load when the system will run
it will have key - value pairs 

u will see one process is running as soon as the system is turned on and we have path of that file too 


regit - to see the registries in windows
